# Introduction
I wanted to create software to solve the Genius Square board game.
The game is a 6x6 board with 9 pieces that you have to fit into the board. The pieces are different shapes and sizes, and the board has a few fixed pieces.
The goal is to fit the pieces into the board in such a way that the pieces do not overlap and that the empty spaces are filled.

I then decided to use computer vision to read in the state of a board and solve it. I don't have any boards
to hand though so I have used paper in this instance.

## How to use
### Computer Vision Mode
Run the __main__ file and put replace the path variable with the path to your own image.

### Random mode
If you want to solve a random problem, run the ```random_solver.py``` file.
